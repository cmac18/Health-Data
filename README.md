Abstract
Each year billions are given to research teams seeking a cure for chronic diseases affecting Americans. This paper proves that by scattering research funds among the search for a cure of five chronic diseases, will actually delay the desired result for each one. Using the top-down approach for my research activity, discovery focused on summary statistics of insurance claims for treatment of each disease. This data was provided by the Center for Medicine and Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse. If the funds scattered are not enough to carry out the necessary research to find a cure, by pooling all funds to focus on the cure for one chronic disease at a time will achieve better results. Using the data provided, the results proved that by pooling resources to focus on one disease first and then moving onto finding a cure for the next chronic disease is a much better approach to tackle these diseases more effectively.
